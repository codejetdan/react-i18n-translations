# 🌐 React Translations

In this cookbook we will implement quick and simple translations into the React project.
## How-to
1. Add necessary dependencies
  ```npm i -S react-intl @formatjs/cli```

2. Add your favourite state management library or just use existing one.
The translations state could be even persisted in React Context.
  ```npm i -S easy-peasy```
